## Using GIT



### Recommended Commit Message Format

> Crafting a Git commit message that follows best practices, includes the elements we specified, and accounts for potential syncing issues across branches is a great idea. The proposed format is already concise and meaningful, but I’ll refine it to ensure clarity, compatibility with GitHub’s ""**autolinking**"" features, and flexibility across environments like GitHub, VS Code, and X. 

**Here's a recommended format and some reasoning:**

```bash
#0.0.22: Address issue #0022 (#FIX_0022) @DavitTec
```

#### Breakdown and Explanation

1. Version (#0.0.22):
   - Including the version number at the start is clear and aligns with semantic versioning (semver) conventions.
   - Adding a colon (:) after the version improves readability and separates it from the description.
2. Short Text with CHANGELOG Reference (#0022):
   - Using #0022 leverages GitHub’s autolinking to reference a heading in your CHANGELOG.md (e.g., ## 0022).
   - Prefixing with "Address issue" provides context, making the message self-explanatory even outside GitHub.
3. Issue Identifier (#FIX_0022):
   - Including #FIX_0022 ties it to an entry in your Issues.md. The parentheses (#FIX_0022) set it apart visually while keeping it associated with the issue number.
   - GitHub doesn’t autolink custom tags like #FIX_0022 unless explicitly defined in a workflow or script, but it’s still useful for your project’s internal tracking.
4. User Tag (@DavitTec):
   - The @DavitTec syntax works perfectly for GitHub, autolinking to a GitHub user. For an X user like @_davit, it won’t hyperlink in GitHub but will still be recognizable in other contexts (e.g., if shared on X).
   - Place it last for consistency and to avoid cluttering the core message.

#### Full Example

```
#0.0.22: Address issue #0022 (#FIX_0022) @@DavitTec
```

- **In GitHub**: #0022 links to issue/PR #0022, and @DavitTec links to the GitHub user.
- **In VS Code**: The # tags are often clickable if you have GitLens or similar extensions installed.
- **In CHANGELOG**: #0022 can correspond to a heading like ## 0022 in CHANGELOG.md.
- **In Issues.md**: #FIX_0022 can be a searchable tag or reference.

#### Handling Sync Issues

- **Version Out of Sync**: If branches diverge, the version (e.g., #0.0.22) might not match the final merged version. Consider updating it during a rebase or merge to the main branch.
- **Issue Numbers**: #0022 will stay consistent as long as it matches an open GitHub issue/PR. Ensure your Issues.md entry (#FIX_0022) aligns with this.
- **User Tags**: @DavitTec won’t break even if the user changes their GitHub handle, though it might not link correctly if mistyped.

#### Alternative Format (More Verbose)

If you want more detail or flexibility:

```
#0.0.22: Fix issue #0022 in CHANGELOG (#FIX_0022) by @DavitTec
```

This adds a verb ("Fix") and context ("in CHANGELOG"), which might help when reviewing logs later.

#### Best Practice Tips

- **Keep it Short**: Aim for 50-72 characters on the first line (Git convention).
- **Use Imperative Mood**: Start with verbs like "Fix," "Add," or "Update" if you prefer action-oriented messages.
- **Autolinking**: Rely on GitHub’s native syntax (# for issues, @ for users) to ensure hyperlinks work.
- **Consistency**: Stick to one format across your project to make parsing easier (e.g., for scripts or changelog generators).



### GitHub’s autolinking features

GitHub’s autolinking features are designed to enhance workflow efficiency by automatically converting specific text patterns into clickable hyperlinks within a repository. These features save time, improve navigation, and connect GitHub content (like issues, pull requests, and commits) to both internal GitHub resources and external systems. Below, I’ll explain all of GitHub’s autolinking capabilities, based on how they work as of March 21, 2025.

### 1. **Built-in Autolinking (Native GitHub References)**
GitHub automatically recognizes and links certain references within comments, issues, pull requests, commit messages, and other Markdown-supported areas. These are native to GitHub and require no configuration:

- **Issues and Pull Requests**:
  - Typing `#` followed by a number (e.g., `#123`) links to the corresponding issue or pull request in the same repository.
  - Example: `#42` becomes a link to issue or PR #42.
  - Cross-repository references are possible with the format `owner/repo#123` (e.g., `octocat/hello-world#456`).

- **Commits**:
  - Referencing a commit’s SHA hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d`) shortens it and links to the commit page.
  - Minimum 7 characters required for uniqueness; full SHA works too.

- **Users and Organizations**:
  - Using `@username` (e.g., `@DavitTec`) links to the GitHub user’s profile.
  - Similarly, `@orgname` links to an organization.

- **URLs**:
  - Any valid URL (e.g., `https://example.com`) is automatically converted into a clickable link.
  - Works in Markdown files, comments, and descriptions but not in wikis or raw file content unless explicitly configured.

- **Labels**:
  - In Markdown, referencing a label’s URL (e.g., from the repository’s labels page) renders the label visually, but only for labels within the same repo.

These built-in autolinks are seamless and work across GitHub’s interface without setup, leveraging its Markdown renderer (GitHub Flavored Markdown, or GFM).

### 2. **Custom Autolink References (External Resources)**
For linking to external systems like Jira, Zendesk, or Trello, GitHub offers configurable **custom autolink references**. This feature is available in repositories under GitHub Pro, Team, Enterprise Cloud, and Enterprise Server plans. Here’s how it works:

- **Configuration**:
  - Repository admins can set this up via **Settings > Autolink references** in the repo.
  - You define a **reference prefix** (e.g., `TICKET-`) and a **target URL template** (e.g., `https://example.com/ticket/<num>`).
  - Two identifier types:
    - **Numeric**: For IDs like `TICKET-123`, where `<num>` is replaced by `123`.
    - **Alphanumeric**: For IDs like `TICKET-3eZr2Bxw`, added in 2022 for broader compatibility (e.g., Trello URLs).

- **Usage**:
  - Once configured, typing `TICKET-123` in a commit message, issue, or PR comment creates a link to `https://example.com/ticket/123`.
  - Example: For Jira, set prefix `JIRA-` and URL `https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/browse/JIRA-<num>`. Then `JIRA-456` links directly to that Jira issue.

- **Limitations**:
  - Prefixes must be unique within a repo (e.g., `TICKET` and `TICK` can’t coexist).
  - Only admins can configure these, and they’re repo-specific (no organization-level setting yet, though requested in discussions).
  - Doesn’t work in wikis or raw files.

- **API Support**:
  - Since 2022, you can manage custom autolinks via the REST API (e.g., `POST /repos/owner/repo/autolinks`) for automation.

This is ideal for integrating GitHub with external tools, reducing manual linking effort.

### 3. **Autolinking Behavior in Context**
- **Where It Works**:
  - Issues, pull requests, discussions, commit messages, PR descriptions, and comments.
  - Markdown files in the repo (e.g., `README.md`) when viewed rendered.
  - Release descriptions.

- **Where It Doesn’t**:
  - Wikis and raw file content (e.g., `.txt` files) unless processed externally.
  - Code blocks (e.g., `` `text` ``) ignore autolinking to preserve formatting.

- **Unfurling**:
  - In task lists, issue/PR references (e.g., `- [ ] #123`) expand to show the title and state (e.g., “Fix bug #123 - Open”).

### 4. **Advanced Notes and Edge Cases**
- **Sync Across Branches**:
  - Autolinks like `#123` always point to the current state of that issue/PR, regardless of branch. If an issue is closed or merged, the link reflects that.

- **Disabling Autolinking**:
  - There’s no native way to disable built-in autolinking (e.g., `#123` or URLs) in GitHub. To prevent it, use code formatting (`` `text` ``) or break the pattern (e.g., `www<area>.example.com` for URLs).

- **Custom Autolink Flexibility**:
  - Alphanumeric support (e.g., `TRELLO-3eZr2Bxw`) was added after feedback, but pre-2022 numeric autolinks remain numeric-only for backward compatibility.

- **Performance**:
  - Built-in links are instant; custom autolinks rely on correct prefix setup and don’t impact rendering speed.

### Practical Example
For your `create_readme` script commit:
- Native: `#0022` links to issue #0022, `@DavitTec` tags the user.
- Custom: Configure `FIX-` to `https://yourdomain.com/issues/FIX-<num>`. Then `FIX-0022` in the message links externally.

### Why It Matters
- **Efficiency**: No need to paste full URLs manually.
- **Traceability**: Connects code changes to issues and external trackers.
- **Collaboration**: Tags users and links resources intuitively.

GitHub’s autolinking blends simplicity (built-in) with customization (external references), making it a powerful tool for developers. If you need more specific examples or help setting up a custom autolink, let me know!
