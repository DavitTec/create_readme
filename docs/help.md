## Using GIT



### Recommended Commit Message Format

> Crafting a Git commit message that follows best practices, includes the elements we specified, and accounts for potential syncing issues across branches is a great idea. The proposed format is already concise and meaningful, but I’ll refine it to ensure clarity, compatibility with GitHub’s ""**autolinking**"" features, and flexibility across environments like GitHub, VS Code, and X. 

**Here's a recommended format and some reasoning:**

```bash
#0.0.22: Address issue #0022 (#FIX_0022) @DAVIt
```

#### Breakdown and Explanation

1. Version (#0.0.22):
   - Including the version number at the start is clear and aligns with semantic versioning (semver) conventions.
   - Adding a colon (:) after the version improves readability and separates it from the description.
2. Short Text with CHANGELOG Reference (#0022):
   - Using #0022 leverages GitHub’s autolinking to reference a heading in your CHANGELOG.md (e.g., ## 0022).
   - Prefixing with "Address issue" provides context, making the message self-explanatory even outside GitHub.
3. Issue Identifier (#FIX_0022):
   - Including #FIX_0022 ties it to an entry in your Issues.md. The parentheses (#FIX_0022) set it apart visually while keeping it associated with the issue number.
   - GitHub doesn’t autolink custom tags like #FIX_0022 unless explicitly defined in a workflow or script, but it’s still useful for your project’s internal tracking.
4. User Tag (@DAVIt):
   - The @DAVIt syntax works perfectly for GitHub, autolinking to a GitHub user. For an X user like @_davit, it won’t hyperlink in GitHub but will still be recognizable in other contexts (e.g., if shared on X).
   - Place it last for consistency and to avoid cluttering the core message.

#### Full Example

```
#0.0.22: Address issue #0022 (#FIX_0022) @DAVIt
```

- **In GitHub**: #0022 links to issue/PR #0022, and @DAVIt links to the GitHub user.
- **In VS Code**: The # tags are often clickable if you have GitLens or similar extensions installed.
- **In CHANGELOG**: #0022 can correspond to a heading like ## 0022 in CHANGELOG.md.
- **In Issues.md**: #FIX_0022 can be a searchable tag or reference.

#### Handling Sync Issues

- **Version Out of Sync**: If branches diverge, the version (e.g., #0.0.22) might not match the final merged version. Consider updating it during a rebase or merge to the main branch.
- **Issue Numbers**: #0022 will stay consistent as long as it matches an open GitHub issue/PR. Ensure your Issues.md entry (#FIX_0022) aligns with this.
- **User Tags**: @DAVIt won’t break even if the user changes their GitHub handle, though it might not link correctly if mistyped.

#### Alternative Format (More Verbose)

If you want more detail or flexibility:

```
#0.0.22: Fix issue #0022 in CHANGELOG (#FIX_0022) by @DAVIt
```

This adds a verb ("Fix") and context ("in CHANGELOG"), which might help when reviewing logs later.

#### Best Practice Tips

- **Keep it Short**: Aim for 50-72 characters on the first line (Git convention).
- **Use Imperative Mood**: Start with verbs like "Fix," "Add," or "Update" if you prefer action-oriented messages.
- **Autolinking**: Rely on GitHub’s native syntax (# for issues, @ for users) to ensure hyperlinks work.
- **Consistency**: Stick to one format across your project to make parsing easier (e.g., for scripts or changelog generators).
