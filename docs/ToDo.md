  - [ ] develop a "create_readme" script

    The code of "create_readme.sh" that GROK previously provided did not work and needs some more amendments.

    But my simple original script; "insert_readme.sh" does work.

    1. I want an insert bash script ("Insert" ) [without extension ".sh") in the folder "./scripts/" to push the "insert_readme.sh" into the user CAJA scripts folder if is installed CAJA (assume >upbutu 20.0) and
    2. to check and compare the current script version in the destination, if exists;
    3. to it executable new script executable;
    4. remove the extension and Capitalise the script name as "INSERT README" so it is cleaner for the menu, upon activating the Caja Scripts option (left mouse)
    5. to add another to the "Package.json" action script, to run the "Insert" script, as to deploy.
